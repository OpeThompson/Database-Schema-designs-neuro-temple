This repository contains a detailed database schema design for a neurology clinic. It includes tables for patients, doctors, neurological assessments, appointments, prescriptions, and billing.

# ETL Pipeline for Neurology Clinic Data

## Overview
This project demonstrates an ETL pipeline for processing patient and appointment data in a neurology clinic. The pipeline extracts data from CSV files, transforms it for consistency, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database.

## Files
- **ETL_Pipeline_Neurology_Clinic.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the full ETL process.
- **patients.csv**: Sample data for patients.
- **appointments.csv**: Sample data for appointments.

## Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and transformation.
- **Pandas**: For handling CSV files and transforming data.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.
- **psycopg2**: For interacting with PostgreSQL from Python.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies: `pandas` and `psycopg2`.
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database locally or in the cloud.
4. Replace the database credentials in the notebook.
5. Run the notebook to execute the ETL pipeline.
